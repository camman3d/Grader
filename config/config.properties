# Specify which assignment the grading is going to grade
# Provide the canonical name of the class that extends FrameworkProjectRequirements or implements ProjectRequirements
#
# The following classes are available for the COMP 401 (F13) assignments:
#   gradingTools.assignment1.Assignment1ProjectRequirements
#   gradingTools.assignment2.Assignment2ProjectRequirements
#   gradingTools.assignment3.Assignment3ProjectRequirements
#   gradingTools.assignment6.Assignment6ProjectRequirements
#   gradingTools.assignment7.Assignment7ProjectRequirements
#   gradingTools.assignment8.Assignment8ProjectRequirements
#   gradingTools.assignment9.Assignment9ProjectRequirements
#   gradingTools.assignment10.Assignment10ProjectRequirements
# For these, use AssignmentX as the project name.

# You can specify which grading controller you want to use
# The options are "GradingManager" (the 'framework' package) or "SakaiProjectDatabase" (the 'grader' package)
grader.controller = GradingManager
#grader.controller = SakaiProjectDatabase

# You can specify how you want the scores saved. You can choose any number of methods.
#   feedback-txt :  This saves a text file in the students' feedback folder
#   feedback-json : This saves a json file in the students' feedback folder
#   feedback :      Equivalent to "feedback-txt + feedback-json"
#   local-txt :     This saves a text file in a local log folder
#   local-json :    This saves a json file in the local log folder
#   local :         Equivalent to "local-txt + local-json"
#   spreadsheet :   This saves all the scores in a spreadsheet
#
# Combine methods with the plus '+' character. Here are some examples:
#   grader.controller.logger = csv
#   grader.controller.logger = feedback-txt + feedback-json
#   grader.controller.logger = local+feedback
grader.logger = local + feedback

# For the spreadsheet, you can specify the location and name of the file.
# If you want to include the project name in the path, use {projectName}.
# The extension should be .xlsx (Excel spreadsheet)
#
# Example:
#   /tmp/log/{projectName}/grades.xlsx
# You can also specify a local path:
#   ./grades.xlsx
grader.logger.spreadsheetFilename = ./log/{projectName}/grades.xlsx

# If you are using SakaiProjectDatabase, then there are further customizations
# Set to true if you want to use the GUI from GraderManager
grader.controller.useFrameworkGUI = true
