# To specify the project you want to grade, you will need to create a .properties file in the 'manifests' subfolder
# In that file, you'll need to specify two or three things:
# 1. The project name
#   project.name = Example Project
#
# 2. If the project requirements is in an external JAR, then provide either the file path or URL to that jar
#   project.grading.jar = http://foo.bar/example.jar
#           OR
#   project.grading.jar = ./example.jar
#           OR
#   project.grading.jar = file:/tmp/example.jar
#
# 3. The canonical class name of the project requirements. This is a class that extends FrameworkProjectRequirements or
#       implements ProjectRequirements.
#   project.grading.requirements = foo.bar.something.ExampleRequirements


# You can specify which grading controller you want to use
# The options are "GradingManager" (the 'framework' package) or "SakaiProjectDatabase" (the 'grader' package)
grader.controller = GradingManager
#grader.controller = SakaiProjectDatabase

# You can specify how you want the scores saved. You can choose any number of methods.
#   feedback-txt :  This saves a text file in the students' feedback folder
#   feedback-json : This saves a json file in the students' feedback folder
#   feedback :      Equivalent to "feedback-txt + feedback-json"
#   local-txt :     This saves a text file in a local log folder
#   local-json :    This saves a json file in the local log folder
#   local :         Equivalent to "local-txt + local-json"
#   spreadsheet :   This saves all the scores in a spreadsheet
#   mysql :         This saves to a MySQL database. More configuration is needed. See below.
#
# Combine methods with the plus '+' character. Here are some examples:
#   grader.logger = csv
#   grader.logger = feedback-txt + feedback-json
#   grader.logger = local+feedback
grader.logger = local + feedback + spreadsheet + mysql

# To do MySQL, you need to enter in the database configuration
grader.logger.mysql.username = autograderuser
grader.logger.mysql.password = UncCompSciRocks
grader.logger.mysql.hostname = jmonson.cs.unc.edu
grader.logger.mysql.schema = autograder


# For the spreadsheet, you can specify the location and name of the file.
# If you want to include the project name in the path, use {projectName}.
# The extension should be .xlsx (Excel spreadsheet)
#
# Example:
#   /tmp/log/{projectName}/grades.xlsx
# You can also specify a local path:
#   ./grades.xlsx
grader.logger.spreadsheetFilename = ./log/{projectName}/grades.xlsx

# If you are using SakaiProjectDatabase, then there are further customizations
# Set to true if you want to use the GUI from GraderManager
grader.controller.useFrameworkGUI = true
